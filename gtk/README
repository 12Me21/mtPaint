-----------
The History
-----------

For simpler installation and more consistent behaviour, official Windows build of mtPaint is packaged with its own copy of GTK+ runtime environment. Prior to version 3.40, it was GTK+ 2.6.4 - or more accurately, a mix of DLLs from official Windows distributions of several different 2.6.x GTK+ versions, with libgdk and libgtk being from 2.6.4. This allowed mtPaint to continue to support for Windows 98 systems, which became unsupported with GTK+ 2.8.

But since version 2.6.4 had been released in 2005, some improvements in Windows support in GTK+ have been made which are really desirable. Still, upgrading the package to a new version of GTK+ would mean exposing the program to a new set of GTK+ bugs and quirks - which would be hard to detect and counter in time, because I myself do not run Windows. For this reason, mtPaint 3.40 comes with custom-built libgdk, libgtk, and libwimp, based on GTK+ 2.6.7 and a set of patches backported from the later versions of GTK+.

In addition, there are couple of my own patches, solving the build problems arising from use of recent MinGW on a Linux box (in GTK+ 2.6.x time, official Windows packages were built with MSVC on Windows).

---------
The Build
---------

The build was done on a Slackware Linux system using MinGW cross-compiler installation combined of the following parts:
- TDM-GCC 4.2.3		( http://www.tdragon.net/recentgcc/ )
- binutils 2.19		( http://mingw.sourceforge.net/ )
- MinGW runtime 3.15.2	( http://mingw.sourceforge.net/ )
- Win32 API 3.13	( http://mingw.sourceforge.net/ )

To replicate it, do the following:
- download and unpack GTK+ 2.6.7 sources from http://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v2.6/gtk+-2.6.7.tar.bz2
- download the Wintab development package from http://www.wacomeng.com/devsupport/downloads/pc/wtkit126.zip
- unpack that package: unzip -LL wtkit126.zip
- rename the 'wtkit126 Folder' directory to 'wintab' and move it into the directory with GTK+ sources ('gtk+-2.6.7')
- apply the cumulative patch: "patch -p0 < gtk267_4wj.patch"
- adjust "GTK_PREFIX", "CFLAGS", "TARGET", "MINGW_TOOL_PREFIX" and "MINGW_BIN" variables in the 'mingw-configure' script according to your MinGW cross-compiler's version and install location
- run 'mingw-configure' from the directory with GTK+ sources
- run 'runmake' from same directory, to compile GTK+
- create a destination directory
- run "make install DESTDIR=full_path_to_destination_directory" to produce the final binaries
- go into your destination directory's 'bin' subdirectory
- run the 'strip' command *from your MinGW package*, like this: "i586-mingw32-strip --strip-unneeded *.dll"
- go into 'lib/gtk-2.0/2.4.0/engines' subdirectory and do the same
